This is my first day trying this stuff out. Hopefully it'll work out. I have an interview coming up.

The plan for today is [[CHECKLIST#Block 1 Arrays - Core Two Pointers & Hashing (Approx. 3h 55m)|Block 1]]
- **Study Questions:**
  - [x] Two Sum (Easy)
  - [ ] Container With Most Water (Medium)
  - [ ] Merge Sorted Array (Easy)
- **Practice Questions:**
  - [ ] Contains Duplicate (Easy)
  - [ ] Squares of a Sorted Array (Easy)
  - [ ] Move Zeroes (Easy)
  - [ ] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Easy)

[[01-Arrays]]Should be simple enough and take less than 3 hours as I know a lot of these concepts already.

## Study Questions
### Two Sum
Not many notes. I already knew this one like everyone does. It's very important though, involves thinking outside of the box and using hashmaps. Overall good, i'm also a bit rusty.
Time Complexity: $O(n)$, Space Complexity $O(n)$
### Max Water
I already know this one as well. I put some notes here but i closed obsidian and didn't save and i'm too lazy to write them again lol
