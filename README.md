Study plan and solutions for algorithm practice

## Framework to follow
### For "Study questions"
1. Read the question
2. Think about it for ~5-10 minutes, think about possible solutions
3. Watch the video/Read solution
4. Understand it completely
5. Implement it myself

### For "Practice questions"
1. Read the question
2. Set a time limit for solving it
3. Think about it for ~5-10 minutes, understand the problem and come up with bruteforce solution
4. Write bruteforce solution, no matter how easy the question is
5. Once bruteforce is working, think about how to optimize it
6. Write optimized solution
7. If time limit reached before solution, read solution and understand it, add it to "study" questions and add another question of the same topic to practice
