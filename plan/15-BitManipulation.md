## Bit Manipulation

### Study Questions (To Learn Patterns)

#### **1. Single Number**

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Description:** Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
- **Reason:** Classic XOR property: `x ^ x = 0` and `x ^ 0 = x`. XORing all numbers together will cancel out pairs, leaving the single number.
- **Focus:** Understand the XOR properties and how they apply to finding the unique element.

#### **2. Number of 1 Bits (Hamming Weight)**

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Description:** Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has.
- **Reason:** Introduces basic bit counting techniques.
- **Focus:** Learn two common methods:
  1.  Loop and check the last bit (`n & 1`), then right shift (`n >>= 1`).
  2.  Brian Kernighan's algorithm: `n = n & (n - 1)` repeatedly, which removes the rightmost set bit in each step. Count steps.

#### **3. Counting Bits**

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Description:** Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the number of 1's in the binary representation of `i`.
- **Reason:** Can be solved with DP and bit manipulation. `dp[i] = dp[i / 2] + (i % 2)` or `dp[i] = dp[i & (i-1)] + 1`.
- **Focus:** Understand the relationship between the number of set bits in `i` and `i/2` (right shift) or `i & (i-1)` (removes last set bit).

#### **4. Reverse Bits**

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Description:** Reverse bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
- **Reason:** Demonstrates bit-by-bit construction of the reversed number.
- **Focus:** Iterate 32 times. In each iteration, take the last bit of the input, append it to the result (by left shifting result and ORing the bit), and then right shift the input.

#### **5. Missing Number**

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Description:** Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
- **Reason:** Can be solved using XOR. XOR all numbers from `0` to `n` together, then XOR this result with all numbers in the `nums` array. The final result is the missing number.
- **Focus:** Similar to "Single Number". The expected set of numbers `[0...n]` is XORed with the actual set `nums`. Paired numbers cancel out.

#### **6. Power of Two**

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Description:** Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return `false`.
- **Reason:** A number is a power of two if it's positive and has only one bit set in its binary representation. This means `n & (n - 1)` will be 0.
- **Focus:** Understand that `n & (n - 1)` unsets the least significant bit. If `n` is a power of two, it has only one set bit, so this operation results in 0. Handle `n <= 0`.

#### **7. Sum of Two Integers**

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Description:** Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators `+` and `-`.
- **Reason:** Simulates binary addition using bitwise operators: XOR for sum without carry, AND followed by left shift for carry.
- **Focus:** `sum = a ^ b` (bits that don't cause a carry). `carry = (a & b) << 1` (bits that cause a carry, shifted left). Repeat until carry is 0.

#### **8. Single Number II**

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Description:** Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
- **Reason:** More advanced bit manipulation. One common approach is to count set bits at each position (0 to 31). For each bit position, the sum of bits modulo 3 will give the bit of the single number.
- **Focus:** Iterate through each bit position. For each position, count how many numbers in `nums` have that bit set. If `count % 3 == 1`, then the single number has that bit set. Construct the result. Another approach uses two bitmasks (`ones`, `twos`).

#### **9. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range**

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Description:** Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
- **Reason:** The bitwise AND of a range of numbers results in their common prefix in binary representation.
- **Focus:** Find the common prefix. One way is to repeatedly right-shift `left` and `right` until they are equal. The number of shifts indicates how many trailing zeros the result will have. Left-shift the common prefix back. Alternatively, `right &= (right - 1)` until `right <= left`. The final `right` is the answer.

#### **10. Subsets** (Bitmasking approach)

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Description:** Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).
- **Reason:** Each number from `0` to `2^n - 1` can represent a subset. The `i`-th bit of the number corresponds to the `i`-th element of `nums`. If the bit is set, include the element.
- **Focus:** Iterate from `0` to `(1 << n) - 1`. For each integer `i` (mask), check its bits. If the `j`-th bit of `i` is set, include `nums[j]` in the current subset.
